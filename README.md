# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Approach-for-the-Automated-Identification-of-in-Cellulo-Crystals

This is an implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image, in our approach the objects include different types of crystals, referred as "G" (left image) and "H" (right image).

This repository includes:
* Source code for training the Mask R-CNN model for crystal segmentation
* Mask R-CNN code is from [this repository](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)
* SLURM script "masks_rcnn_script.sh" for submitting jobs to the computation cluster, for the paper the [Maxwell Cluster](https://confluence.desy.de/display/MXW/) is used.
* The file "requirements.txt" includes all the libraries relevant to run the project.
* The "utils" folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for pre-processing the images and creating annotation masks from JSON files.

**NOTE**
Train/Test images, annotations/masks (in JSON format), all trained models and prediction results are publicly available for download at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10475962).
